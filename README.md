# Python Application Development and Testing

This project is a simple demonstration of Python application development and testing. It includes the following components:

## Components

### 1. Application Script (`app.py`)
- Contains a basic function `greet(name)` that returns a greeting message.
- Runs the greeting function when executed directly.

### 2. Testing Suite (`test_app.py`)
- Implements unit tests for the `greet` function using Python's `unittest` framework.
- Ensures the functionality of the application through automated testing.

### 3. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Lists the required Python packages for development and testing:
  - `flake8` for code linting.
  - `pytest` for testing.
  - `coverage` for measuring code coverage.
  - `bandit` for security analysis.

### 4. Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)
